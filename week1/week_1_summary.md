# Summary of Week 1

## Why Companies are Failing at Analytics

- Facts:
    - Even though more companies are investing in data analytics, the number identifying as being data driven is declining.
    - 93% of respondents identify people and process issues as the obstacle
    - 40.3% identify lack of organization alignment and 24% cite cultural resistance

1. People
2. Culture
3. Other reasons:
    1. Short-term financial goals pushes longer-term objectives 
    2. Failure of others causes caution, hesitation 
    3. Lack of technology support

- Solution:
    - identify specific projects and business initiatives that move a company 
    - communication initiatives to promote the successes 
    - implement agile methods in key programs 
    - reduce the cultural barriers to business adoption 
    - be creative about addressing the human side of data
    - Investing heavily in technology, clearly is not enough

## Analytics Comes of Age

### Part 1. Analytics Grows Up

- Shifts:
    - Industries and sector borders are changing 
    - Leaders can exploit new openings to go on offense, as well. 
    - Now is the time to take stock and to start shaping nascent opportunities.
    - Customer Expectations 
        - Customer-centric, unified value proposition going beyond of what the prior customer expectations were
    - Ecosystems 
        - Seamless business integration
        - Lower lag
    - Customer-Centricity
- The AI Rollercoaster
    - Most of the investment in AI has consisted of internal spending—R&D and deployment—by large, cash-rich digital native companies
- AI Adoption
    - adopters are from sectors already investing at scale in related technologies
    - large companies tend to invest in AI faster at scale
    - adopters go broader as they adopt multiple AI tools (not just one basket)
    - adopters investing at scale do it close to their core business
    - motivated as much by the upside growth potential of AI as they are by cutting costs
    - adopters have strong executive leadership
- C-Suite Insights
    - Analytics can create new opportunities and disrupt entire industries. But few leaders can say how
    - Surprisingly few companies know where and how analytics can create value
    - Data science is the easy part. Getting the right data, and getting the data ready for analysis, is much more difficult
    - The talent challenge is not only to find data scientists but also to groom 'translators '
    - Data ownership and access need to be democratized
    - Embedding analytics is as much about change management as it is about data science
    - Learn to love metrics, and measure, measure, measure
    - The fastest way to a big idea is to cultivate a datadriven, test-and-learn culture
    - There is no universal way to organize an analytics operating model
- Data Monetization
    - Changing the way business is done 
        - Lack of commitment to whole-sale changes
        - Lack of partnership between business and IT 
        - Need a firm-wide partnership
    - A differentiator 
    - Fundamental building blocks 
    - Foresight
- Data Lakes
    - ![lecture_1](objects/lecture_1.png)
    - Using data effectively requires the right data architecture, built on a foundation of business requirements.
        - Putting technology before strategy can result in:
            - Redundant and inconsistent data storage 
            - Overlapping functionality 
            - A lack of sustainability
