# Notes

## Descriptive Analytics

- Describe what happened in the past
- Associated with EDA
- Not majority of time, usually
- E.g. mean, median, sums, percent changes, etc.
- Most graphs: e.g. bar charts, histograms, time-charts, box plots, pie charts
- CI's, hypothesis tests
- Clustering
- Regression inference (not prediction)

## Predictive Analytics

- Predicting the future
- Not Descriptive Analytic, though it is tempting to turn Descriptive Analytics into predictive analytics
- Forecasting models, classification/regression models for prediction, not inference as a goal
- E.g. linear/logistic regression
- Spatial forecasting
- ARIMA
- Supervised ML/Deep Learning

## Prescriptive Analytics

- The Holy Grail of analytics
- Most rare
- Tells an end user what they should by generating outcomes from a variety of different scenarios, controlling for risks/unknowns; determining the best scenario
- Optimization models
- Monte Carlo Simulations
- Discrete Event Simulation

Other notes:

- The path between the three is often more cyclical than linear
